# üõ°Ô∏è Project Protector ‚Äì Intelligent PII Detection, Masking & Restoration System

## üß© Chosen Problem Statement

In sensitive industries like finance, healthcare, and government, the need to handle Personally Identifiable Information (PII) securely is paramount. Manual data redaction processes are time-consuming, error-prone, and non-scalable. Rule-based systems (e.g., regex, keyword matching) suffer from low precision/recall trade-offs and lack adaptability to domain-specific or novel sensitive terms, leading to compliance and operational risks. The challenge is to build a system that can automatically detect, mask, and restore sensitive data, even from scanned documents and domain-specific formats, while allowing users to customize and improve the model over time.

## üß† Explanation of the Solution

Our solution ‚Äî Project Protector ‚Äî is an AI-powered PII processing pipeline that combines the robustness of Named Entity Recognition (NER), the adaptability of OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT, and the compliance-ready architecture of Microsoft Presidio. It supports both structured (CSV, TXT) and unstructured formats (PDF, images) through integrated OCR.

### Key Components:
1. Multi-Layered PII Detection:

	- NER Engine (SpaCy/Huggingface) for baseline entity recognition.

	- Domain Dictionary Filter for organization-specific terms (e.g., ‚ÄúLoan ID‚Äù, ‚ÄúMedical Record #‚Äù).

	- ChatGPT API for fuzzy candidate mining and novel sensitive pattern discovery (e.g., obfuscated names, nicknames).

2. Presidio Integration:

	- All results from above layers are passed to Presidio Analyzer for standardized detection and validation.

	- Presidio Anonymizer applies irreversible masking or reversible encryption.

3. OCR for Scanned Documents:

	- Using EasyOCR to extract multilingual text (English + Malay) from PDF/image files before PII processing.

4. Restoration Mode:

	- Encrypted sensitive info is stored with metadata (bounding box, type, encryption key).

	- Users can later decrypt and restore the data for authorized recovery.

5. Continuous Improvement:

	- Detected new terms by ChatGPT are added to the domain dictionary.

	- A background script can re-train the NER model periodically with accumulated data to improve detection accuracy.

### Supported Features:
- üîê End-to-end encryption for PII
